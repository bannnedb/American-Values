# This test is back!

The original creator, TheAmeliaMay, discontinued this test, and left a message behind, explaining why the test was discontinued, as well as saaying:
"Feel free to fork this project and continue my work, but I'll no longer be contributing. I met my goal of adapting 8values, and I'm moving on to other projects."
I really enjoyed taking the test back when it was around, and now I have the files and have decided to reupload the test, for now I will not be making any changes.
The original discontinuation message is at the top of the screen of the starting page.

# What is AmericanValues?
AmericanValues is a political quiz inspired by 8values, but tailored to the political climate of the United States. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!

You can take the test [here.](https://bannnedb.github.io/AmericanValues/)
